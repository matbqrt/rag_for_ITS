    "This service package supports numerous services for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and construction on a roadway system or right-of-way.  Maintenance services include landscape maintenance, hazard removal (roadway debris, dead animals), routine maintenance activities (roadway cleaning, grass cutting), and repair and maintenance of both ITS and non-ITS equipment on the roadway (e.g., signs, traffic controllers, traffic detectors, dynamic message signs, traffic signals, CCTV, etc.).  Environmental conditions information is also received from various weather sources to aid in scheduling maintenance and construction activities.",
    "This service package supports the detection and enforcement of roadway control signals.  A common implementation of this capability is \"red light enforcement\" for signalized intersections.  Information documenting a vehicle entering the intersection when the light is red is captured and conveyed to an enforcement agency. This service package is a logical predecessor to \"Intersection Safety Warning\" and \"Intersection Collision Avoidance\", where the signal violation detection is also used to reduce the likelihood of a traffic accident.  This same relationship also exists to \"Mixed Use Warning Systems\" and \"Automated Non-Vehicular Road User Protection\", since pedestrians, bicyclists, and other non-vehicle traffic may be threatened by signal violations.",
