To fully capitalize on the system's capabilities, we implemented three example files. Each of them corresponding to one of our pipeline step : 
- Indexing : how to create an external database. This data source will be used to help the generation model answering.
- Pipeline : once you have implemented your database, you will be able to proceed to both the retrieval step and the generation step.
- Evaluation : we propose in this notebook different text evaluation metrics to measure the system performance in answering correctly.

Because running the bleurt evaluation metric requires extra data, we won't be using it in these examples.
